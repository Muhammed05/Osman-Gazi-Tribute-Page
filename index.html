                The father of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">Ottoman Empire </a> 
                 Osman Gazi was born in 1258 in the town of <a class="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B6%C4%9F%C3%BCt">Sogut</a>. <br>
                 His father was <a class="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ertu%C4%9Frul">Ertugrul Gazi</a> and his mother was Hayme Sultan. Osman Gazi was a tall man with a round face, <br>
                  dark complexion, hazel eyes, and thick eyebrows. His shoulders were fairly large and the upper part of <br>
                   his body was longer than the other parts. He used to wear a Horasan crown in the style of Cagatay, <br>
                 which was made of red broad cloth. Osman Gazi was a brilliant leader. He was fair, brave and gracious. <br>
                  He helped the poor. Sometimes he gave his own cloths to the poor. Every mid-day, he gave a lavish meal to all people in his house. <br>
                Osman Gazi was just 23 when he succeeded the leadership of the Kayi Clan in Sogut, in 1281. <br>
                 He was a very brilliant rider and a fencer. He married to Mal Sultana who was the daughter of famous Omer bey. <br>
                  Mal Sultan gave birth to Orhan who succeeded the throne. After his ascension to throne, he gathered several Turcoman groups <br>
                   around himself and fought against <a class="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantines</a>, collaborating with Alaeddin Keykubad I of the Seljuks. <br>
                    When the Seljuk Empire remained rulerless after the exile of Alaeddin Keykubad, Osman Gazi reunited them under <br>
                     his rule in 1299 marking the history as the foundation of the Ottoman Empire. Osman Gazi continued his campaigns against the <br>
                      remaining Byzantine Empire in the area along with his brothers, sons, and close supporters. He cut the Byzantine trade <br>
                       routes forcing local rulers to surrender. After 1320 he got sick so his sons continued to fight, capturing many towns <br>
                        from the Byzantines. He died of gout at the age of 68 in Sogut and buried in
                        <a class="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursa">Bursa</a> . <br>
                 When he died, he left an horse armor, a pair of high boots, a few sun jacks, <br> a sword, a lance, a tirkes, a few horses,
                  three herds of sheep, salt and spoon containers. <br> <br>
